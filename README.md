## Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the dependencies.

```bash
$ composer install
```

## Usage

Instantiating the client requires passing in your client id and secret, which you can register for on the [Shutterstock Developers site](https://developers.shutterstock.com/).

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Shutterstock\Api\Client($clientId, $clientSecret);
```

Interacting with the different endpoints is as simple as reading the [API documentation](https://developers.shutterstock.com/api/v2). There are two main methods of the client to deal with - `Client::get` and `Client::post` - which take an endpoint as their first argument and the client parameters as the second.

```php
// perform an image search for puppies
$client->get('images/search', array('query' => 'puppies'));

// retrieve details for a handful of image ids
$client->get('images', array('id' => array(1, 2, 3)));

// create a lightbox
$client->post('images/collections', array('name' => 'Lightbox Name Here'));
```

Each request will return a PSR-7 response object, which you can read about on the [Guzzle/PSR7 repo](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7). The response object bodies have been decorated with a JsonSerializable interface to allow easier handling of the default API responses.

```php
$imageResponse = $client->get('images', array('id' => array(1, 2, 3)));
if ($imageResponse->getStatusCode() != 200) {
    // error handler
}
$images = $imageResponse->getBody()->jsonSerialize()['data'];
// etc
```

If your application is setup to handle async CURL requests, you can also make `Client::getAsync` and `Client::postAsync` calls, which return [Guzzle Promises](https://github.com/guzzle/promises).
